# Java-Chess

### Chess Engine with BDD Testing Methods and AI .

Objective was to develop and test a bug-free standalone game in Java, complete with a GUI and game logic components.

This program is a chess game. The user may play against a friend or the computer.

GUI inspired by: https://en.lichess.org/

## Technology

This game is built using core Java, Java Swing GUI libraries and the jUnit test suite. It uses custom drawing for game components and self-programmed logic for checkmate detection. The code is modular, standalone and object-oriented.

## Testing Methods

#### Test-driven development
#### Behaviour-Driven Development {work In Progress}

## How it works?

The game state is mainly stored as a 2D list of strings, and most of the processing is thus done on a list of strings.

The GUI takes the current state and displays it on the screen. The GUI allows drag and drop movement of pieces as well as click-click movement.

***Focus of this engine is simplicity and readability. This is by no means the optimal way to build the chess engine.***
